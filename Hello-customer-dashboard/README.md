# Hello Customer Portal

The customer-centric “ Hello-Customer Portal” where customers can buy in the local online store or pre-book required orders from large farmer communities.
The HelloCustomer Portal will be inclusive to the registered users, where they can buy products based on their priority.

There will be two sections:
The first one is the local online market:
The second section will be the one where bulk orders

 The first one is the local online market:  page based on the locality, where the organic and homegrown products with lower cultivation periods ranging from 1 - 2 months and certain products that have longer life periods in storage(ex: Packed rice, wheat, etc). 

Here the targeted customers will be people within a certain radius of the locality. This ensures that farm-fresh products can be delivered well within the community to ensure growth for the local market. 

The online shopping portal will be designed based on a simple and easy-to-use UI.
The customer can give ratings to the delivered products as well.

The second section will be the one where bulk orders can be made in advance by hotel-restaurant chains or larger organizations who are in need of larger amounts of product. This will include products that are cultivated on a seasonal basis, or products that have a longer cultivation period, say 3-4 months.
 It also includes organic vegetables, fruits, and homegrown products as well, but since the quantity of the goods needed is high, the customer should pre-book the order with a forecasted date of delivery and a booking amount.

 This method ensures that farmers can focus their resources to cultivate products only for the required demand.  
To explain this, let’s say that a hotel book X quantity of vegetables, Since the group of farmers, are managed by a government overseen local community, the demand(X) can be divided among multiple producers to ensure, everyone from small farmers to large scale producers will be included equally involved in the production and they’ll be paid for their allocated demand(X/n) - where n being the number of farmers/producers who are capable of delivering the required product from their farm.
