# Hello Farmer Portal

The farmer/producer-centric ”HelloFarmer portal” where farmers can see the required demand and cultivate products based on the demand or sell their pre-made or homegrown products which are market-ready in the local online market.

The HelloFarmer portal will be unique to the producers/Source including the farmers and the local governing community.


If the orders are booked for the local community, i.e, for low supply products - daily use products which are bought by people within the community. An online shopping platform from which the customer would book their orders and farm-fresh products can be delivered to customers directly. Here when a customer books in order, it will be notified to the producer directly in their dashboard.



If the orders are booked as bulk for large organizations, the local authority can divide the demand across the farmers and an estimate can be made on how much quantity each farmer/producer can deliver if there are multiple farmers cultivating the same product. In this case, the booked quantity is shown in the local community dashboard. They can divide it among themselves.

In case if the booked demand is higher than the production capacity of the community, the local community can associate with the neighboring communities to divide the demand. Thus ensuring the demand is delivered without fail.
