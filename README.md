# Hello-Harvest-Project

This project is created as a part of Google Cloud fest hackthon 2022. By Team Inevitables

# Introduction

 The Indian supply chain structure that is currently being implemented is not really beneficial to the farmers even though they are the key in the entire process. As per the Department of Agriculture and farmers welfare, the average return that a farmer gets for his/her product is less than 25%.

 The sole reason behind this is the presence of a middle man or a structure that acts as an agent between the source and the market. This also directly influences the price fluctuation.

The Hello Harvest Project contains the following dashboards:

  <li>Hello Customer Dashboard</li>
  <li> Hello Farmer Dashboard</li>
</ul>

# Hello Farmer Portal

The farmer/producer-centric ”HelloFarmer portal” where farmers can see the required demand and cultivate products based on the demand or sell their pre-made or homegrown products which are market-ready in the local online market.

The HelloFarmer portal will be unique to the producers/Source including the farmers and the local governing community.


If the orders are booked for the local community, i.e, for low supply products - daily use products which are bought by people within the community. An online shopping platform from which the customer would book their orders and farm-fresh products can be delivered to customers directly. Here when a customer books in order, it will be notified to the producer directly in their dashboard.



If the orders are booked as bulk for large organizations, the local authority can divide the demand across the farmers and an estimate can be made on how much quantity each farmer/producer can deliver if there are multiple farmers cultivating the same product. In this case, the booked quantity is shown in the local community dashboard. They can divide it among themselves.

In case if the booked demand is higher than the production capacity of the community, the local community can associate with the neighboring communities to divide the demand. Thus ensuring the demand is delivered without fail.


# Hello Customer Portal

The customer-centric “ Hello-Customer Portal” where customers can buy in the local online store or pre-book required orders from large farmer communities.
The HelloCustomer Portal will be inclusive to the registered users, where they can buy products based on their priority.

There will be two sections:
The first one is the local online market:
The second section will be the one where bulk orders

 The first one is the local online market:  page based on the locality, where the organic and homegrown products with lower cultivation periods ranging from 1 - 2 months and certain products that have longer life periods in storage(ex: Packed rice, wheat, etc). 

Here the targeted customers will be people within a certain radius of the locality. This ensures that farm-fresh products can be delivered well within the community to ensure growth for the local market. 

The online shopping portal will be designed based on a simple and easy-to-use UI.
The customer can give ratings to the delivered products as well.

The second section will be the one where bulk orders can be made in advance by hotel-restaurant chains or larger organizations who are in need of larger amounts of product. This will include products that are cultivated on a seasonal basis, or products that have a longer cultivation period, say 3-4 months.
 It also includes organic vegetables, fruits, and homegrown products as well, but since the quantity of the goods needed is high, the customer should pre-book the order with a forecasted date of delivery and a booking amount.

 This method ensures that farmers can focus their resources to cultivate products only for the required demand.  
To explain this, let’s say that a hotel book X quantity of vegetables, Since the group of farmers, are managed by a government overseen local community, the demand(X) can be divided among multiple producers to ensure, everyone from small farmers to large scale producers will be included equally involved in the production and they’ll be paid for their allocated demand(X/n) - where n being the number of farmers/producers who are capable of delivering the required product from their farm.

# Future Scope

Adding eggs and other dairy agricultural products which have low storage lifespan into the market.
Developing a delivery system rather than leaning on external delivery service providers.
Exposure to global market to promote import business
Adding the other markets by including dairy and meat products.
Ability to invite and include funding from external investors to promote organic home farming as a high level business opportunity.
By ensuring that large organizations use the service to book bulk products, we can promote the organization’s brand as they are also being a part of providing the farmers in India a helping hand.
